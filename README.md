# Linear Statistical Models Final Project

## Project Overview
This Final project aims to apply statistical methods and model selection techniques learned in my Linear Statistical Models Course to determine the best model to fit a real world set of data. 

## Data Chosen
The World Happiness Report reviews the state of happiness in the world. The data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 3,000 data points from a survey from the Gallup World Poll. Information from the World Development Indicators and the World Health Organization was also used. 

## Objective 
We want to create a model to understand what factors influence a nation's happiness. 

## Tools and Technologies
This project was done in R Markdown using R, utilizing its data analytics tools to gather key insights about the data. 

## Results and Visualizations 
All relevant outputs are in the All Results pdf. A condensed version of key results and visualizations are in the 439 Final WriteUp w_Appendix pdf.
